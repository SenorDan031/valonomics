# VALONOMICS (Temporary Name)

VALONOMICS is a Valorant performance analytics engine built with a C++ core and a Python UX layer.  
It analyzes match statistics, visualizes KD performance, and provides gameplay insights to help players improve aim and climb ranks.

The project is currently in active development.

## Overview

VALONOMICS started as a console-based ACS calculator and evolved into a modular analytics engine.

The development workflow is:

- **C++** → Core engine, logic validation, performance calculations
- **Python** → UX, visualizations, reports, and future commercial layer

C++ acts as the **source of truth**.  
Python reflects approved and validated features.
